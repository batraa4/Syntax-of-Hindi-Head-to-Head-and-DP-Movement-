# Syntax-of-Hindi-Head-to-Head-and-DP-Movement-

## Introduction:
According to India's 2011 census, Hindi is spoken by 528,347,193 monolinguals, 139,207,180 bilinguals, and 24,160,696 trilinguals as a native language (Government of India 2011). This is not to mention the many native speakers living outside of India. All my relatives, including my parents, are fluent. However, I am only bilingually receptive, making this paper quite valuable for me personally.

In this paper I will explore Head-to-Head movement and DP movement. Basic data indicates the tense is located on the right side of the VP. Therefore, it is likely that all verbs may raise. (Aldridge 2008) mentions that Hindi is a split-ergative language. As I have yet to look into the cases of Hindi, my hypothesis is that the subject may receive case in the specifier of the TP, similar to English. Passive voice may also move the object to the same position to receive case. I will first look into gender and plurality, cases, and the X-bar Theory/ Deep Structure. I will then look into movements, supplementing my analysis with papers. I will collect data directly from my parents (see my Data Statement for more information).
